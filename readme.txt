%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

@ Whenever you update a problem or post a solution try to add a comment, so that others get to know you have updated something.

@ If you want to change some colors, feel free to do so (just leave out a comment that you have made a change). 

@ If you want to create newenvironments or newcommands, use the styles.tex file. Try to keep the main.tex file as clean as possible.

@ Update your problem in the problems folder, all the problems will be included in the main.tex from the file problem.tex in the folder problems. And similarly solutions should be updated in solution.tex in the folder solutions.
